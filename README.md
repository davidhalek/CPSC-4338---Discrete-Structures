# CPSC-4338---Discrete-Structures Team 4 Project 

This contains the project requirements, final design document, and the PowerPoint presentation.

For this project, I was the team leader. I provided the direction for the project and basically ensured that everything happened the way it needed to happen and on time.

We were told that it was the most complete project in the class, and we did receive an 'A' for it.

Incidentally, this was probably my favorite class to-date. Everything in it was focused on applying the concepts, as you would need to understand them in the 'real world.'  There was a ton of work involved, but it was definitely a highlight for me.
