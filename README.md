# CPSC-4338---Discrete-Structures
 
# Team 4 Project 

# This contains the project requirements, final design document, 
# and the PowerPoint presentation.

# For this project, I was the team leader. I provided the direction
# for the project and basically ensured that everything happened the
# way it needed to happen and on time.

# We were told that it was the most complete project in the class,
# and we did receive an 'A' for it.

# Apparently we were also responsible for a lot of the teams getting
# the query-processing algorithm as I had made some effort to point
# people toward the shunting algorithm and postfix notation.  

# Another team got the word out, so most of the groups got it right.

# Incidentally, this was probably my favorite class to-date.  
# Everything in it was focused on applying the concepts, as you would 
# need to understand them in the 'real world.'  There was a ton of
# work involved, but it was definitely a highlight for me.
