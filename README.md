# CPSC-4338---Discrete-Structures
 
# Team 4 Project 

# This contains the project requirements, final design document, and the PowerPoint presentation.

# For this project, I was the team leader. I provided the direction for the project and basically 
# ensured that everything happened the way it needed to happen, when it needed to happen.

# We received an 'A' for it, and were also told that it was the most complete one in the class.

# Apparently we were also responsible for a lot of the teams getting the query-processing algorithm
# right, as I had made some effort to point people toward the shunting algorithm and postfix
# notation.  Another team got the word out, so most of the groups got it right.

# Incidentally, this was probably my favorite class to-date.  Everything in it was focused on
# applying the concepts, as you would need to understand them in the 'real world.'  There was a 
# ton of work involved, but it was definitely a highlight for me.
